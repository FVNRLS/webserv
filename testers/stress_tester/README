Build a Docker image with the tag "siege":                                                      docker build . -t siege
Run a Docker container with the image "siege":                                                  docker run siege
Get the container ID of the running container:                                                  docker ps and note down the "CONTAINER_ID"
Open a bash terminal in the running container:                                                  docker exec -it 'CONTAINER_ID' bash
Alternatively, if you named your container, you can use the container name instead of its ID:   docker exec -it 'container_name' bash
Inside the container, run ifconfig | grep "inet" to determine the private IP address of the container
Start the server and siege on the host's private IP address
Use the IP address and port number to run siege:                                                siege http://IP_ADDRESS:PORT
After you are finished, remove all stored container data with:                                  docker system prune --all


commands:
docker build . -t siege
docker run siege
docker ps -> to get 'CONTAINER_ID'
docker exec -it 'CONTAINER_ID' bash
docker exec -it 'container_name' bash
ifconfig | grep "inet"      -> to know private ip address
run server AND siege on host private ip address
siege http://IP_ADDRESS:PORT
docker system prune --all -> to remove all stored container data
