# webserv
This project is about writing your own HTTP server. You will be able to test it with an actual browser. HTTP is one of the most used protocols on the internet. Knowing its arcane will be useful, even if you wonâ€™t be working on a website.


# How does it work?
## Setup
- compile with ``make``, compile with Cmake, compile with GODS CLI_HELP....
- activate with ``webserv`` and specify the configuration file
- pick a browser of your choice and visit the server's website by entering the address specified in the ``*.conf`` file (standard is localhost)
